Let's say it like it is: The most iconic meeting in comic book history leaves people oddly dissatisfied. The cast is not to blame. Opposed to what the haters expected, Affleck is a great Batman and Wayne. The other new names work great as well, only Eisenberg's Luthor is way overacting, channeling Ledger's Joker a little too obviously. Of course the visuals are great, but there is a darkness to the film that goes beyond the deadly serious storytelling that leaves little space for actual fun. 
The whole first hour consists of detective work, senate hearings, dream sequences and set up. The film wakes up for its second half with a literal bang and actually has a lot of action from there on out. Some of it is great, other parts are just a massive, fake looking CGI overload against a creature you couldn't care less about. At least the foreshadowing of things to come and new heroes to join is really well done and makes you look forward to more, even if a lot of potential has been wasted here.
No catastrophe like some critics make it out to be, but also nowhere near the level Marvel keeps delivering for years. It's just disappointing to say that when Batman met Superman the result was actually just okay.
