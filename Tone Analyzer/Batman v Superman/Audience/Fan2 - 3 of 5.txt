In terms of spectacle and action Batman v Superman mostly delivers the goods, but in terms of narrative excellence, it is simultaneously plodding and just plain not good enough for these classic characters. Ben Affleck does make a good Batman and gives a great performance, but I did not really like this interpretation of Batman. I prefer my Batman with morals and not a vigilante who does not care anymore. The fact that we don't get a backstory for this version of Batman only makes it worse. Maybe there's a reason for his actions, but obviously we are never told them so it how are we supposed to know? I liked Henry Cavill in Man of Steel and I liked him here too. Jesse Eisenburg was his normal self, but it worked enough. Gal Gadot and the Wonder Woman character seemed shoe horned in, but nonetheless added some juice. I really wanted to love this, but I find myself asking how a different director would have done. At this point, we know Snyder's strengths and weaknesses as a director and they are on full display in this movie. This isn't as bad as people are making it out to be and can be enjoyable, but it could have been so much more given the source material. If you are interested though, go ahead and see it. I want them to go forward with the Justice League and a standalone Batman movie with Ben Affleck so maybe we can get some context into this version of the character. Maybe then we can look back on this with different opinions.
