Zack Snyder clashes some titans in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.

Starting with a good point of view on an event already passed, the 150 minute story pushes along as it should. The storytelling in the first half is a little shaky, but as the film progresses, it all gets better, leading to a successful ending. The character buildup and main plot-line setup make this a lengthy piece, but even so, there feels like pieces of story are missing.

The action is nicely done and backed with successful cinematography. The CG has its ups and downs, but for the most part, gets the job done.

Ben Affleck does wonders and actually carries the film most of the way. Gal Gadot is a delight with her few scenes. Jesse Eisenberg is amusing in his own right, not sure if it's a solid fit for his character though. Henry Cavill is the weakest link, partially due to the writing.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice isn't perfect. Ups and downs and strengths and weaknesses show up on screen. Fortunately, there are more of the positives than the negatives.
